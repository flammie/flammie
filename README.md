### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**flammie/flammie** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

1. working with @divvun and @giellalt
2. spare time working with all Uralic langauge technology
  - see @acl-sigur Association of Computationa Linguistics' Special Interest Group for Uralistics
3. you *can* sponsor me via github sponsors / patreon (->increased support for 2.)
