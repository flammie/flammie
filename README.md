### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**flammie/flammie** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

1. working with [divvun] and [giellalt]
2. spare time working with all Uralic langauge technology
3. you *can* sponsor me via github sponsors / patreon (~increased support for 2.)
